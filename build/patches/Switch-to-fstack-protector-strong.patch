Subject: Switch to -fstack-protector-strong

This compiler option is already used for ChromeOS, but not yet on other
platforms because there is push back against enabling an option resulting in
~1-2% lower performance and ~2-3% larger binaries.

The size increase on Android is something they care a lot about since some
devices have very little storage space. That also means ever so slightly
higher memory/cache usage but not by the full 2-3%.
