# Goals

Bromite aims at providing a no-clutter browsing experience without privacy-invasive features and with the addition of a fast ad-blocking engine.
Minimal UI changes are applied to help curbing the idea of "browser as an advertisement platform".

### Flags

Flags which have been retired from upstream Chromium but are still available in Bromite.

* `#enable-horizontal-tab-switcher`
* `#pull-to-refresh`
* `#enable-search-ready-omnibox`

# Privacy limitations

Bromite's privacy features, including anti-fingerprinting mitigations (which are not comprehensive), **are not to be considered useful for journalists and people living in countries with freedom limitations**, please look at [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) in such cases.

# Releases

All built versions are available as [releases](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/releases); the [official website](https://www.bromite.org/) points to those releases and - when browsing via Android - it will automatically highlight the one apt for your device (or none otherwise).

Each tag corresponds to a Chromium Stable release tag.

Bromite is currently built for ARM, ARM64 and x86 and for the Android SDK versions 19 and 21; [Bromite SystemWebView](https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view) is provided as well (SDK21+).
For every Bromite build you can always find a matching [vanilla Chromium](https://www.bromite.org/chromium) build which is used for example to verify which issues are specific to Bromite or not.

All official releases are also available through the [official third-party F-Droid repository](https://www.bromite.org/fdroid).

## Integrity and authenticity

You can verify the integrity of a downloaded APK file from this project with any `sha256sum`-compatible tool by downloading the corresponding `brm_X.Y.Z.sha256.txt` or `chr_X.Y.Z.sha256.txt` file, where X.Y.Z is the release version number. Example:
```
$ sha256sum --check brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt
arm64_SystemWebView.apk: OK
arm64_ChromePublic.apk: OK
arm64_ChromeModernPublic.apk: OK
```

You can verify authenticity, e.g. that the author ([csagan5](https://github.com/csagan5)) released the file, by using gpg2:
```
$ gpg2 --quiet --verify brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt.asc
gpg: assuming signed data in 'brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt'
gpg: Signature made Sun 08 Jul 2018 04:22:52 PM CEST using RSA key ID D85DC0C5
gpg: Good signature from "csagan5 <32685696+csagan5@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

You can download csagan5's public GnuPG key from here: [csagan5.asc](./csagan5.asc).

# How to build

The [Bromite main repository](https://github.com/bromite/bromite) contains tags for each corresponding Chromium release (see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git).

Please refer to [official Chromium build documentation](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code) to get started on how to build Chromium; if you can build Chromium for Android, you can build Bromite.

The GN args used to build Bromite are available here: [GN_ARGS](./build/GN_ARGS).
The patches are to be applied second the order specified in the `bromite_patches_list.txt` file (you can use `git am`).

## How to build the filters

See upstream documentation: https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/components/subresource_filter/FILTER_LIST_GENERATION.md

Bromite uses an unindexed filter file, which is periodically published at https://github.com/bromite/filters
