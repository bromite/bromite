# Goals

Bromite aims at providing a no-clutter browsing experience without privacy-invasive features and with the addition of a fast ad-blocking engine.
Minimal UI changes are applied to help curbing the idea of "browser as an advertisement platform".

# Privacy limitations

Bromite's privacy features, including anti-fingerprinting mitigations (which are not comprehensive), **are not to be considered useful for journalists and people living in countries with freedom limitations**, please look at [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) in such cases.

# Releases

All built versions are available as [releases](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/releases); the [official website](https://www.bromite.org/) points to those releases and - when browsing via Android - it will automatically highlight the one apt for your device (or none otherwise).

Each tag corresponds to a Chromium Stable release tag.

Bromite is currently built for ARM, ARM64 and x86 and for the Android SDK versions 19 and 21; [Bromite SystemWebView](https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view) is provided as well (SDK21+).
For every Bromite build you can always find a matching [vanilla Chromium](https://www.bromite.org/chromium) build which is used for example to verify which issues are specific to Bromite or not.

You can automatically receive notifications about new updates (and install them) by enabling the auto updater functionality, see [related wiki page](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki/AutomaticUpdates).

All official releases are also available through the [official third-party F-Droid repository](https://www.bromite.org/fdroid).

## Integrity and authenticity

You can verify the integrity of a downloaded APK file from this project with any `sha256sum`-compatible tool by downloading the corresponding `brm_X.Y.Z.sha256.txt` or `chr_X.Y.Z.sha256.txt` file, where X.Y.Z is the release version number. Example:
```
$ sha256sum --check brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt
arm64_SystemWebView.apk: OK
arm64_ChromePublic.apk: OK
arm64_ChromeModernPublic.apk: OK
```

You can verify authenticity, e.g. that the author ([csagan5](https://github.com/csagan5)) released the file, by using gpg2:
```
$ gpg2 --quiet --verify brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt.asc
gpg: assuming signed data in 'brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt'
gpg: Signature made Sun 08 Jul 2018 04:22:52 PM CEST using RSA key ID D85DC0C5
gpg: Good signature from "csagan5 <32685696+csagan5@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

You can download csagan5's public GnuPG key from here: [csagan5.asc](./csagan5.asc).

# How to build

The [Bromite main repository](https://github.com/bromite/bromite) contains tags for each corresponding Chromium release (see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git).

Please refer to [official Chromium build documentation](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code) to get started on how to build Chromium; if you can build Chromium for Android, you can build Bromite.

The Chromium version tag used as base for the patches is available here: [RELEASE](./build/RELEASE); this is always corresponding to the git tag for every release.
The GN args used to build Bromite are available here: [GN_ARGS](./build/GN_ARGS).
The patches are to be applied second the order specified in the `bromite_patches_list.txt` file (you can use `git am`).

## How to build the filters

See upstream documentation: https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/components/subresource_filter/FILTER_LIST_GENERATION.md

Bromite uses an unindexed filter file, which is periodically published at https://github.com/bromite/filters
